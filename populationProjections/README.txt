README for demographic simulation models

The R package needed for the individual-based simulations is here and its named quantPop_0.3.9.tar.gz

rCode_populationProjections.R is the script that will run the simulations of the future population dynamics. Lines 8-19 are preliminary information that should be decided on by the user

rCode_simulateSourcePopulation.R is the script that will simulate the source population for input into rCode_simulateSourcePopulation.R. 

fit.rds has the Bayesian survival model output from our paper. 

demog_models_projection.Rdata has the demographic information on the current SRKW population

pedigreeForSimulations_30Nov2021 is the pedigree of the current SRKW population

quantPop_0.3.9.tar.gz is the R package needed to run the simulations of the source populations and of the future population dynamics.
