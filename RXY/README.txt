Files in this folder were used to generation the R_X/Y metric of genetic load in the Southern Residents, Transients, and Alaska Residents, and to calculate the number of homozygous deleterious alleles in each individual. 

rCode_processAncestralAlleles_1August2022 produces a matrix of indicators for derived versus ancestral allele state at every polarized locus in each individual, and a file that links these genotypes to sites in the genome

rCode_rxy_killerWhaleLoads_2August2022.R calculates R_XY for all pairwise combinations of SRKW, ARKW, TKW
variant_effect_output_skinny is the output from the Variant Effect Predictor

orcaIDForROHAnalysis contains IDs of individuals to include in the analysis

orca_pops_ids.txt links IDs to populations

rCode_calculateSFS_neutralAndDamaging_homozygousLoads_28June2022 is the script that calculates the SFS, and counts homozygous LOD and missense alleles in each individual
